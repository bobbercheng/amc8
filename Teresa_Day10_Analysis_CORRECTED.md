**Correct:** 1-12 (perfect!)
**Missed:** Problem 13 (digit reversal)

**Analysis:**
- Teresa was PERFECT on problems 1-12
- Only missed #13 due to not knowing the "digit reversal = multiple of 9" rule
- This is EXCELLENT performance on easy problems!

### Problems 14-18: 3/5 (60%) ✅

**Correct:** 14, 16
**Missed:** 15, 17, 18

| Problem | Teresa | Correct | Topic |

## 🎯 PROBLEMS TERESA MISSED (6 total)

### 1. Problem 13 - Digit Reversal (EASY - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Teresa's answer:** D
**Correct answer:** A (45)

**What it tested:** Number theory - digit reversal property

**Why she missed it:**
Clara reversed a two-digit score (like 52 → 25). The difference between the original and reversed number is always a multiple of 9:
- Original: 10a + b
- Reversed: 10b + a
- Difference: 9(b - a)

Only 45 = 9×5 is divisible by 9.

**Fix:** 5 minutes to learn the rule, Teresa will never miss this type again!

---

### 2. Problem 15 - Exponent Equations (MEDIUM - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Teresa's answer:** A (27)
**Correct answer:** B (40)

**What it tested:** Solving basic exponent equations

**Solution:**
- $3^p + 81 = 90$ → $3^p = 9 = 3^2$ → **p = 2**
- $2^r + 44 = 76$ → $2^r = 32 = 2^5$ → **r = 5**
- $5^3 + 6^s = 1421$ → $125 + 6^s = 1421$ → $6^s = 1296 = 6^4$ → **s = 4**
- Product: **2 × 5 × 4 = 40**

**Why she missed it:** Calculation error or picked wrong answer choice

**Fix:** 10 minutes of careful practice on exponent equations

---

### 3. Problem 17 - Consecutive Integers (MEDIUM - HIGH PRIORITY)
**Teresa's answer:** A (335)
**Correct answer:** B (338)

**What it tested:** Sum of consecutive integers

**Solution:**
- Sum of 6 consecutive integers = 2013
- Let first = n: n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) + (n+5) = 2013
- 6n + 15 = 2013
- 6n = 1998
- n = 333
- **Largest = 333 + 5 = 338**

**Why she missed it:** Setup or arithmetic error

**Fix:** 10 minutes to practice consecutive integer formula

---

### 4. Problem 18 - 3D Hollow Fort (MEDIUM - MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Teresa's answer:** D (340)
**Correct answer:** B (280)

**What it tested:** 3D geometry - counting blocks in hollow structure

**Solution:**
- Fort is 12×10×5 feet with 1-foot thick walls
- Total volume: 12×10×5 = 600 blocks
- Hollow interior: 10×8×4 = 320 blocks (subtract 2 from each dimension for walls)
- Blocks used: 600 - 320 = **280 blocks**

**Why she missed it:** Didn't correctly subtract the hollow interior

**Fix:** 15 minutes practicing hollow structure problems

---

### 5. Problem 20 - Semicircle + Rectangle (HARD - LOW PRIORITY)
**Teresa's answer:** B (2π/3)
**Correct answer:** C (π)

**What it tested:** Pythagorean theorem + circle area

**Solution:** Requires setting up Pythagorean theorem with rectangle inscribed in semicircle.

**Why acceptable to miss:** Hard geometry problem, not a core gap

**Fix:** Optional - only if extra time

---

### 6. Problem 21 - Path Counting (HARD - LOW PRIORITY)
**Teresa's answer:** D (12)
**Correct answer:** E (18)

**What it tested:** Combinatorics - counting shortest paths

**Solution:** Combination of paths before park (3 ways) × paths after park (6 ways) = 18

**Why acceptable to miss:** Combinatorics is not Teresa's strength, and this is a hard problem

**Fix:** Skip - not worth drilling for 1 problem

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Perfect on problems 1-12** (100%!)
