## 📋 PROBLEMS TERESA MISSED:

### Easy Section (1-13):
**Problem 13:** Digit reversal difference (chose D, correct A)
- **Gap:** Reversing digits creates difference divisible by 9
- **Fix time:** 10 minutes
- **Priority:** HIGH (easiest point to gain!)

### Medium Section (14-18):
**Problem 15:** Exponent equations (chose A, correct B)
- $3^p + 81 = 90$ → $p = 2$
- $2^r + 44 = 76$ → $r = 5$
- $5^3 + 6^s = 1421$ → $s = 4$
- Product: $2 \times 5 \times 4 = 40$
- **Gap:** Careless calculation or forgot to multiply
- **Fix time:** 10 minutes
- **Priority:** HIGH (straightforward algebra)

**Problem 17:** Consecutive integers (chose A, correct B)
- Sum of 6 consecutive integers = 2013
- Let first integer = $n$: $n + (n+1) + ... + (n+5) = 2013$
- $6n + 15 = 2013$ → $n = 333$
- Largest = $333 + 5 = 338$
- **Gap:** Setup or arithmetic error
- **Fix time:** 10 minutes
- **Priority:** HIGH (should-get problem)

**Problem 18:** 3D hollow fort blocks (chose D, correct B)
- **Gap:** 3D visualization/counting
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (more complex)

### Hard Section (19-25):
**Problem 20:** Semicircle with inscribed rectangle (chose B, correct C)
- **Gap:** Pythagorean theorem application
- **Priority:** LOW (hard problem, not worth drilling)

**Problem 21:** Path counting combinatorics (chose D, correct E)
- **Gap:** Combinatorics - not Teresa's strength
- **Priority:** LOW (acceptable to miss)

## 📅 DAY-BY-DAY PLAN

### Saturday, January 17 - "Quick Fixes" (30 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Fix the 3 "should-get" problems

#### Part 1: Digit Reversal Rule (10 min)
**Fix Problem 13 type:**

When you reverse two digits (like 37 → 73), the difference is always a multiple of 9:
- Original: $10a + b$
- Reversed: $10b + a$
- Difference: $(10b + a) - (10a + b) = 9b - 9a = 9(b-a)$

**Practice:**
- If you reverse 52 to 25, what's the difference? (27 = 9×3) ✓
- If you reverse 81 to 18, what's the difference? (63 = 9×7) ✓
- Which could be the difference: 45, 46, 47, 48, 49? → **45 only** (9×5)

**This fixes Problem 13!** ✓

#### Part 2: Exponent Equations (10 min)
**Fix Problem 15 type:**

**Solve step-by-step:**
1. $3^p + 81 = 90$ → $3^p = 9 = 3^2$ → $p = 2$ ✓
2. $2^r + 44 = 76$ → $2^r = 32 = 2^5$ → $r = 5$ ✓
3. $5^3 + 6^s = 1421$ → $125 + 6^s = 1421$ → $6^s = 1296 = 6^4$ → $s = 4$ ✓
4. Product: $2 \times 5 \times 4 = 40$ ✓

**Practice 2-3 similar problems:**
- $2^x + 8 = 24$ → $x = ?$
- $5^y = 125$ → $y = ?$
- What is $3 \times 4 \times 2$?

**This fixes Problem 15!** ✓

#### Part 3: Consecutive Integers (10 min)
**Fix Problem 17 type:**

**Formula for sum of consecutive integers starting at $n$:**
- Sum of $k$ consecutive integers = $kn + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}$

**For Problem 17:**
- 6 consecutive integers sum to 2013
- $6n + 15 = 2013$
- $6n = 1998$
- $n = 333$
- Largest = $333 + 5 = 338$ ✓

**Quick check:** Average = $2013 \div 6 = 335.5$, so integers are 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338 ✓

**Practice:**
- Sum of 4 consecutive integers = 74. What's the largest?
- Sum of 5 consecutive integers = 100. What's the smallest?

**This fixes Problem 17!** ✓

**End of Day:** Teresa now knows how to solve 3 MORE problems! Potential score: **22/25 (88%)**! 🎉

**Create one-page "cheat sheet":**
- Key formulas (d=rt, area formulas, exponent rules, consecutive integers)
- Common traps ("which is NOT", unit conversions, digit reversal)
