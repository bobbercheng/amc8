## 📈 PATH TO 80% (EXACT NUMBERS)

### Current Performance (In Quiet Environment)
**17/25 (68%)**
- Problems 1-13: 12/13 (92%)
- Problems 14-18: 2/5 (40%)
- Problems 19-25: 3/7 (43%)

### After Teaching Problem 17
**Expected: 18/25 (72%)**
- Problems 1-13: 13/13 (100%) - fix #9 with focus
- Problems 14-18: 3/5 (60%) - add #17
- Problems 19-25: 3/7 (43%) - maintain

### Competition Day Goal
**Target: 20/25 (80%)**
- Problems 1-13: 13/13 = 13 points
- Problems 14-18: 4/5 = 4 points
- Problems 19-25: 3/7 = 3 points
- **TOTAL: 20 points**

**Gap to close: Only 3 more problems (17→20)**

## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

To get from 17/25 to 20/25, Teresa needs:

**1. Fix Problem 9 (cube icing - careless error)** → +1 point
- She didn't redo this one
- It's a spatial reasoning problem
- With quiet focus, she can likely solve it

**2. Fix Problem 17 (prime factorization)** → +1 point
- Teach the systematic method (25 minutes)
- This is the ONLY critical concept gap remaining

**3. Improve one more in Problems 14-18** → +1 point
- Could be #16 (logic puzzle with practice)
- Could be #18 (geometry - lower probability)
- Or get both #16 and #18, creating buffer room

**Total: 17 + 3 = 20/25 = 80%** ✅

- Practice 3-4 similar problems
- This alone gets her to 18/25 (72%)

### 3. Build Confidence
**Teresa is AHEAD of schedule:**
- She's at 68% (above baseline 64%)
- She only needs 3 more problems
- She DOES understand percentages (#15)
- She CAN solve hard problems (#19, #20, #22)

## 🎉 CELEBRATION POINTS

**Teresa fixed FIVE problems on redo:**
1. ✅ Problem 12 (factorials)
2. ✅ Problem 14 (bar chart)
3. ✅ **Problem 15 (percentage equations)** - She DOES understand this!
4. ✅ Problem 19 (flippy numbers - HARD problem!)
5. ✅ Problem 20 (tree heights - HARD problem!)

**Key Message for Teresa:**
*"You're at 68% - that's ABOVE your baseline! You fixed 5 problems when you had a quiet environment. You only need 3 MORE problems to hit your 80% goal. You've got this!"*

## 📝 REVISED DAY 6 PLAN

**Part 1 (25 min): Prime Factorization**
- Teach Problem 17 method
- Practice 3-4 similar problems
- This is the ONLY critical gap remaining

**Part 2 (25 min): Medium Problem Practice**
- Practice 8-10 problems from #11-16 range
- Focus on: bar charts, logic puzzles, counting
- Build confidence and speed
- Goal: 6-8/10 correct

**Part 3 (10 min): Celebrate Wins**
- She fixed FIVE problems (not four!)
- She's at 68% (above baseline!)
- Only 3 more points needed!

---

**Final Thought:** The 12/25 score was environmental noise, not Teresa's true ability. Her real performance is 17/25 (68%), and she's on track to hit 20/25 (80%) on competition day!

🎯 **Teresa is CRUSHING IT!**
