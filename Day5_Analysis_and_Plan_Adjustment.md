### Problems 14-18 (Medium): 0/5 (0%) 🔴 CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

**This is the BIGGEST concern - Teresa got ZERO medium problems correct.**

| Problem | Teresa's Answer | Correct | Topic | Why She Missed It |
|---------|----------------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **14** | **C** | **D** | Bar chart interpretation | Should be easy - likely rushed or misread chart |
| **15** | **D** | **C** | Percentage equation (15% of x = 20% of y) | Algebra error: 0.15x = 0.2y → y = 0.75x = 75% |
| **16** | **C** | **E** | Logic puzzle with digits on lines | Complex constraint problem - harder |
| **17** | **A** | **B** | Number theory (factors of 2020) | Requires prime factorization knowledge |
| **18** | **D** | **A** | Rectangle in semicircle (geometry) | Advanced geometry - Pythagorean theorem application |

**Detailed Analysis:**

**Problem 14 (Bar Chart - SHOULD BE EASY!):**
- Teresa chose C, correct is D
- This is reading a bar chart and estimating average × 20 cities
- If average ≈ 4750, then total ≈ 95,000
- **Why she missed it:** Rushed calculation or misread the average line

**Problem 15 (Percentage - SHOULD BE EASY!):**
- Teresa chose D, correct is C
- Equation: 15% of x = 20% of y → 0.15x = 0.2y
- Solve for y: y = (0.15/0.2)x = 0.75x = 75% of x
- Teresa likely chose D (133⅓%) by dividing the wrong way (20/15)
- **Why she missed it:** Set up equation incorrectly or inverted the fraction

**Problem 16 (Digit Logic Puzzle):**
- Complex constraint problem - harder, but doable
- Requires systematic trial-and-error
- **Why she missed it:** Ran out of time or didn't attempt systematically

**Problem 17 (Number Theory):**
- Requires finding factors of 2020 = 2² × 5 × 101
- Then identify which factors have >3 factors themselves
- **Why she missed it:** Doesn't know prime factorization method

**Problem 18 (Geometry):**
- Rectangle ABCD inscribed in semicircle
- Requires setting up Pythagorean theorem
- **Why she missed it:** Advanced geometry beyond her current level

**Verdict:** Teresa COLLAPSED on medium problems. This is the opposite of what should happen after Week 1 training.

### Problems 19-25 (Hard): 1/7 (14%) - Expected

| Problem | Teresa's Answer | Correct | Topic | Status |
|---------|----------------|---------|-------|--------|
| 19 | E | B | Flippy numbers divisible by 15 | ❌ |
| 20 | A | B | Tree height pattern | ❌ |
| 21 | E | A | Checkerboard paths | ❌ |
| **22** | **E** | **E** | Machine algorithm sequences | ✅ |
| 23 | E | B | Distributing awards (combinatorics) | ❌ |
| 24 | C | A | Tiles with borders (algebra) | ❌ |
| 25 | B | A | Rectangles and squares puzzle | ❌ |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Got #22 correct (machine sequences) - shows she CAN solve hard problems when she understands the pattern
- ❌ Missed the rest (expected for hard problems)

**Verdict:** 1/7 is within expected range for hard problems.

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### What Went Wrong?

**Hypothesis 1: Time Management Failure** ⚠️ MOST LIKELY
- Teresa may have spent too much time on Problems 1-13 trying to be perfect
- Then rushed through Problems 14-18 without careful work
- **Evidence:** She got "easy" medium problems wrong (#14, #15)

**Hypothesis 2: Didn't Follow the 3-Pass Strategy** ⚠️ LIKELY
- If she attempted all 25 problems linearly, she may have:
  - Gotten stuck on #14-18
  - Panicked and started guessing
  - Not saved time to come back to skipped problems

**Hypothesis 3: Week 1 Training Didn't Transfer** ⚠️ POSSIBLE
- The daily practice didn't build test-taking resilience
- Practice problems ≠ actual test pressure
- She knows concepts but can't execute under timed conditions

**Hypothesis 4: 2020 AMC 8 Is Harder Than 2023/2024** ⚠️ POSSIBLE
- Problems 14-18 in 2020 might be objectively harder
- Need to compare difficulty across years

**Hypothesis 5: She Gave Up Mentally** ⚠️ POSSIBLE
- After missing a few medium problems, she lost confidence
- Started guessing randomly on the rest
- **Evidence:** She guessed "E" on 5 different problems (19, 21, 22, 23, 9)

## 📋 QUESTIONS TO ASK TERESA

**Before adjusting the plan, we need to understand what happened:**

1. **Time Management:**
   - Did you finish the test, or did you run out of time?
   - How much time did you spend on Problems 1-13?
   - Did you skip any problems and come back to them?

2. **Strategy:**
   - Did you use the 3-Pass Strategy (15 min / 15 min / 10 min)?
   - Did you use the 3-Check System on Problems 1-13?
   - When you got to Problem 14, what happened?

3. **Mindset:**
   - Did you feel panicked at any point?
   - Did you feel like you "knew how" to solve Problems 14-18, or were they confusing?
   - Did you guess on Problems 14-18, or did you try to solve them?

4. **Environment:**
   - Was it a quiet place with no interruptions?
   - Did you take it seriously like a real test?

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### Option A: Continue with Plan (If time management was the issue)
**Use this if Teresa says:** *"I ran out of time"* or *"I didn't follow the 3-Pass Strategy"*

**Adjustments:**
- Day 6 (Friday): Focus HEAVILY on time management and test strategy
- Add a 30-minute "timed drill" session before Day 10 practice test
- Reduce Week 2 content coverage, focus on test execution

### Option B: Moderate Plan Revision (If she panicked or gave up)
**Use this if Teresa says:** *"I got stuck on #14-15 and started guessing"* or *"I felt overwhelmed"*

**Adjustments:**
- Add a "reset strategy" - what to do when you miss 2-3 in a row
- More focus on building confidence through easier practice sets
- Add a mini practice test (15 problems, 20 min) before Day 10

### Option C: Major Plan Overhaul (If she genuinely doesn't know the concepts)
**Use this if Teresa says:** *"I didn't know how to solve most of Problems 14-18"*

**Adjustments:**
- Week 2 needs MAJOR content focus, not just strategy
- Add targeted lessons on:
  - Reading charts/graphs
  - Setting up algebra equations from word problems
  - Number theory basics (prime factorization, counting factors)
- Consider extending timeline or reducing 80% goal to 75%

## 📝 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WEEK 2

### Regardless of Path, These Changes Are MANDATORY:

**1. Add "Mid-Problem Check-In" Strategy**
- After Problem 13: Check clock (should have 25 min left)
- After Problem 18: Check clock (should have 10-12 min left)
- If behind schedule → SKIP hard problems immediately

**2. Add "Reset" Strategy for Consecutive Misses**
- If you miss 2 problems in a row:
  - Take 3 deep breaths
  - Skip the next problem if it looks hard
  - Come back to easy-looking problems
  - Don't panic!

**3. More Emphasis on "Guess and Move On"**
- If stuck on a problem for >2 minutes:
  - Eliminate 2 wrong answers
  - Guess from remaining 3
  - MOVE ON (don't dwell)

**4. Specific Content Gaps to Address:**
- **Bar charts/Graph reading:** Do 5-10 practice problems
- **Percentage equations:** Review setup method (a% of x = b% of y)
- **Factorial arithmetic:** Practice simplifying factorials
- **Prime factorization:** Learn the method for 2020-level numbers

**5. Add a "Rescue Session" on Weekend**
- If Day 10 score is still below 16/25
- Weekend intensive becomes 4 hours:
  - Hour 1: Intensive concept review (gaps identified)
  - Hour 2: Practice test
  - Hour 3: Review + strategy refinement
  - Hour 4: Confidence drills

## 🎯 FINAL THOUGHTS

**The Reality Check:**

Teresa's Day 5 performance is a **wake-up call**. The 12/25 (48%) score tells us:

1. ✅ **What's working:** She CAN get 85% on easy problems (11/13)
2. ❌ **What's NOT working:** She COLLAPSED on medium problems (0/5)
3. ⚠️ **The concern:** This suggests test-taking issues, not just content gaps

**The Good News:**
- This is a PRACTICE test - better to fail now than on competition day
- We have 2 weeks to fix the issues
- Teresa has the intelligence - she just needs the strategy

**The Hard Truth:**
- 80% (20/25) is looking less achievable with current trajectory
- 72-76% (18-19/25) is more realistic
- We may need to extend timeline or adjust expectations

**The Path Forward:**
1. **Debrief with Teresa immediately** - understand what happened
2. **Adjust Week 2 based on findings** - follow Option A, B, or C
3. **Set realistic expectations** - 18-19/25 is still excellent for 7th grade!
4. **Focus on consistency** - 13/13 on easy + 5/12 on medium = 18/25

**Remember:** Teresa is smart and capable. This is a LEARNING experience. The goal is progress, not perfection.

---

**Next Action:** Please share Teresa's feedback on what happened during the Day 5 test so we can choose the right adjustment path.
