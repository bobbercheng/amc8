**January 10-16, 2026**

**Goal:** Reach 18-20/25 through smart test-taking + targeted skill building

---

## Day 6 - Friday, January 10
### **Practice Test #1 Review + Optimization** (60 min)

#### Part 1: Deep Review of Wednesday's Test (30 min)
**Go through EVERY mistake on AMC 8 2020**

**Categorize each error:**

| Problem # | Answer | Correct | Error Type |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------|
| | | | ❌ Careless / ⚠️ Rushed / ❓ Don't Know |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Error Types:**
- ❌ **Careless:** Knew how to solve, made silly mistake
- ⚠️ **Rushed:** Ran out of time or didn't read carefully
- ❓ **Don't know:** Genuinely didn't know the concept

#### Part 2: Targeted Practice (25 min)
**Based on error analysis, practice 5-6 problems in weak areas**

Examples:
- If missed 2 geometry → Do 5 more geometry problems
- If missed ratios → Do 5 more ratio problems
- If made careless errors → Slow down, practice 3-Check System

#### Part 3: Time Management Refinement (5 min)
**Review the 3-Pass Strategy - Did Teresa follow it?**

**Adjust if needed:**
- Too slow on 1-13? → Speed drills needed
- Stuck on 14-18? → Learn to skip and return
- Left blanks? → Practice guessing strategies

---

## Day 7 - Monday, January 13
### **Medium-Hard Problem Workshop** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Master 2-3 more problem types in the 14-20 range

#### Part 1: Optimization Problems (20 min)
**Study 2023 Problem 14** (stamps for $7.10)
- Teresa chose B, correct is E (55 stamps)
- **Key strategy:** Work backwards from constraints
  - Need $7.10 = 710 cents
  - Maximize # of stamps → use smallest denominations
  - 20× 5¢ + 20× 10¢ + 15× 25¢ = 100+200+375 = 675... adjust

**Practice 2 similar optimization problems**

**Key insight:** Guess-and-check is OK when done systematically!

#### Part 2: Statistics Basics (20 min)
**Study 2023 Problem 20** (mode, median, range)
- Teresa chose A, correct is D
- Quick review:
  - **Mode:** Most frequent value
  - **Median:** Middle value when sorted
  - **Range:** Maximum - minimum

**Practice 3-4 statistics problems from AMC 8 past tests**

**This is an easy concept** - should be a quick win!

#### Part 3: Number Theory Shortcuts (20 min)
**Study 2024 Problem 15** (FLYFLY = 8 × BUGBUG)
- Teresa chose D, correct is C
- **Key:** Look for patterns
  - ABCABC = 1001 × ABC
  - So: 1001 × FLY = 8 × 1001 × BUG
  - Therefore: FLY = 8 × BUG

**Practice 2-3 number pattern/digit problems**

**Strategy:** Try simple examples first, then scale up

---

## Day 8 - Tuesday, January 14
### **Probability Fast Track** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Get at least 1/2 probability problems right (currently 0/2)

#### Part 1: Probability Crash Course (15 min)
**Basic formula:**
```
P(event) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes
```

**Common patterns:**
1. **Independent events:** Multiply probabilities
   - Example: P(heads AND heads) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4

2. **"At least one":** Use complement
   - P(at least one) = 1 - P(none)

3. **Counting outcomes:** Systematic listing
   - Make a table or tree diagram

#### Part 2: Guided Problem Solving (20 min)
**Study 2024 Problem 25** (airplane seats)
- Teresa chose A, correct is C
- Walk through solution step-by-step:
  1. Total ways to seat 2 people in 4 empty seats = combinations
  2. Ways to have 2 adjacent seats = count per row
  3. Calculate probability

**Practice 2 similar "arrangement" probability problems**

#### Part 3: Practice Set (20 min)
**Do 5-6 basic-to-medium probability problems**
- Focus on AMC 8-style (not competition-level hard)
- Sources: AMC 8 2017-2022 (excluding 2021), probability problems

**Goal:** Build intuition, not master all cases

#### Part 4: Probability Checklist (5 min)
**For every probability problem:**
- [ ] Identify total number of outcomes
- [ ] Identify favorable outcomes
- [ ] Set up fraction: favorable/total
- [ ] Simplify fraction
- [ ] Check: Is answer between 0 and 1?

**Reality check:** Teresa won't master probability in 1 hour, but might get 1-2 more right!

---

## Day 9 - Wednesday, January 15
### **Strategic Guessing & Problem Triage** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Maximize points when you don't know everything

#### Part 1: The Art of Strategic Guessing (20 min)
**Golden Rule:** NEVER leave a blank! (No penalty for wrong answers)

**Elimination Strategy:**
1. Cross out obviously wrong answers
2. Look for patterns in answer choices
   - If 4 choices are small, 1 is huge → probably not the huge one
   - If 4 choices are similar, 1 is different → check the different one
3. Use estimation
   - Example: If calculating area ≈ 50, eliminate choices like 200 or 5

**Practice:** Take 5 hard problems Teresa would normally skip
- For each: Eliminate 2-3 choices, then guess
- **Don't solve!** Just practice the elimination skill

#### Part 2: The 2-Minute Rule (20 min)
**Practice with 10 mixed problems:**

**For each problem:**
1. Read carefully (30 seconds)
2. If you know how to start → Solve (max 2 min total)
3. If you're stuck → Eliminate bad answers, guess, MOVE ON

**Goal:** Don't get bogged down on any single problem

**Time total:** Should finish all 10 in 20 minutes max

#### Part 3: Final Pass Strategy for Problems 21-25 (20 min)
**The Reality:** Problems 21-25 are HARD. Teresa doesn't need to master them.

**Strategy:**
1. **Quick read** all 5 problems (2 min)
2. **Pick 1-2** that seem most doable
3. **Spend 3-4 min** on those problems only
4. **Guess intelligently** on the rest using elimination

**Practice:** Use AMC 8 2019 Problems 21-25
- Set timer for 10 minutes
- Apply strategy above
- Score: ___/5 (Goal: 2-3 correct through combination of solving + lucky guessing)

- **Pass 2 (15 min):** Problems 14-20 → Attempt all, get 4-5/7
- **Pass 3 (10 min):** Problems 21-25 → Strategic attempts, get 2-3/5

#### Part 2: Immediate Debrief (20 min)
**Score the test:**

| Section | Score | Goal | Met Goal? |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|
| Problems 1-13 | ___/13 | 12-13 | ✅ / ❌ |
| Problems 14-18 | ___/5 | 3-4 | ✅ / ❌ |
| Problems 19-25 | ___/7 | 2-3 | ✅ / ❌ |
| **TOTAL** | **___/25** | **18-20** | ✅ / ❌ |

## Parent/Coach Notes

**What to watch for:**

✅ **Good signs:**
- Teresa is getting 12-13/13 on Problems 1-13
- She's attempting all problems (no blanks)
- Practice test scores are 17-20/25
- She's using the 3-Check System consistently
- She can explain her strategies

⚠️ **Warning signs:**
- Still making careless errors on Problems 1-10
- Leaving problems blank (not guessing)
- Spending >2 min on single problems
- Getting frustrated and rushing
- Practice test scores below 16/25

**How to support Teresa:**

**During practice:**
- Encourage her to show all work (even on easy problems)
- Don't interrupt during timed tests
- Celebrate small wins ("You got 13/13 on the easy ones!")
- Help her learn from mistakes without judgment
- Keep sessions to 1 hour (don't extend)

**Motivation tips for last-minute learners:**
- "You only need to practice 1 hour today, then you're done!"
- "You're already at 81% on easy problems - just don't mess those up!"
- "You only need 4 more correct answers, not perfection"
- "Smart people know when to skip hard problems - that's strategy!"

**Test day:**
- Don't quiz her on the way to the test
- Stay positive and calm
- Remind her: "Do your best, have fun, no pressure!"
- Have a fun activity planned for after the test

## FINAL REMINDERS

### For Teresa:
**You are SMART enough. You are PREPARED enough. You've GOT this!**

**Remember:**
- Read every problem twice (it's worth 10 seconds!)
- Show your work (even on easy ones)
- Don't get stuck (2-minute rule!)
- Guess smartly (eliminate wrong answers first)
- Stay calm (you know more than you think!)

**Your target:** 20/25 = 80%
**Your strategy:** Be perfect on easy, be smart on medium, be strategic on hard

**The secret:** You're already at 81% on Problems 1-13. Just don't mess those up, get half the medium ones right, and guess on the rest. That's 20/25. You can do this!

### For Parents/Coach:
**This plan is designed for a smart student who doesn't like lengthy practice.** Every hour is high-ROI. Trust the process.

**Keys to success:**
1. Enforce the 1-hour limit (don't over-practice)
2. Focus on eliminating careless errors (biggest point gain)
3. Teach strategy, not just content (when to skip, when to guess)
4. Keep it positive (celebrate progress, not just perfection)
5. Weekend intensive is crucial (don't skip it!)

**Good luck! 🍀**
