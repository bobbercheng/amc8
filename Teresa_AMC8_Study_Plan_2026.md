## Day 4 - Wednesday, January 8
### **Counting, Logic & Patterns** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Master systematic counting (Problems 13-16 range)

#### Part 1: Analyze Your Strengths (15 min)
**Review problems Teresa got RIGHT:**
- 2023 #13 (water stations spacing) ✓
- 2024 #13 (bunny hopping paths) ✓

**What's Teresa's natural strength?**
- _______________________________________

#### Part 2: Learn from Mistakes (10 min)
**Study 2023 Problem 16** (P, Q, R pattern in table)
- Teresa chose E, correct is C
- **Key strategy:** Find the repeating unit, then count carefully
- Walk through solution

#### Part 3: Systematic Counting Practice (30 min)

# WEEK 2: STRATEGY & TEST MASTERY
**January 10-16, 2026**

**Goal:** Reach 18-20/25 through smart test-taking + targeted skill building

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE FROM DAY 5

**Day 5 Results:** Teresa scored 12/25 (48%) - BUT she was in a LOUD community center with interruptions!

**Redo Results:** When Teresa redid the wrong problems in a quiet environment, she fixed **5 problems:**
- ✅ Problem 12 (factorials)
- ✅ Problem 14 (bar chart)
- ✅ **Problem 15 (percentage equations)** ← She DOES understand this!
- ✅ Problem 19 (flippy numbers - HARD problem!)
- ✅ Problem 20 (tree heights - HARD problem!)

**Adjusted realistic score:** **17/25 (68%)** ← ABOVE baseline!

**Breakdown:**
- Problems 1-13: 12/13 (92%)
- Problems 14-18: 2/5 (40%)
- Problems 19-25: 3/7 (43%)

**KEY LESSON:** Environment matters HUGELY! Teresa can solve medium AND hard problems when focused.

**Only ONE critical gap remains:**
1. ✅ ~~Problem 15 (percentages)~~ - **FIXED on redo!**
2. ❌ **Problem 17 - Prime factorization method** ← Only gap to teach!
3. Problems 16/18 - Logic puzzles / advanced geometry (lower priority)

**ACTION ITEMS FOR WEEK 2:**
- ✅ **CRITICAL:** Ensure quiet, focused environment for ALL tests (Day 10, Weekend)
- ✅ Day 6: Teach prime factorization (25 min) + practice medium problems (35 min)
- ✅ Day 7-9: Practice and confidence building
- ✅ Day 10: Full test in QUIET space (expect 18-20/25)

**Revised confidence in 80% goal:** **80%** (up from 50%) 🎯

---

## Day 6 - Friday, January 10
### **Prime Factorization + Medium Problem Practice** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Fix the ONE remaining concept gap + build confidence on medium problems

**🎉 GREAT NEWS:** Teresa scored 17/25 (68%) when adjusted for environment! She fixed FIVE problems on redo, including Problem 15 (percentages) - she DOES understand percentage equations! Only ONE gap remains.

#### Part 1: Number Theory - Prime Factorization (25 min)
**Fix Problem 17 - The ONLY critical gap remaining**

**Teach the method:**
1. **Prime factorization of 2020:**
   - 2020 ÷ 2 = 1010
   - 1010 ÷ 2 = 505
   - 505 ÷ 5 = 101 (101 is prime)
   - **2020 = 2² × 5 × 101**

2. **List ALL factors systematically:**
   - 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 101, 202, 404, 505, 1010, 2020

3. **For each factor, count HOW MANY factors it has:**
   - 1: {1} = 1 factor ❌
   - 2: {1,2} = 2 factors ❌
   - 4: {1,2,4} = 3 factors ❌
   - 5: {1,5} = 2 factors ❌
   - 10: {1,2,5,10} = 4 factors ✓
   - 20: {1,2,4,5,10,20} = 6 factors ✓
   - 101: {1,101} = 2 factors ❌
   - 202: {1,2,101,202} = 4 factors ✓
   - 404: {1,2,4,101,202,404} = 6 factors ✓
   - 505: {1,5,101,505} = 4 factors ✓
   - 1010: {1,2,5,10,101,202,505,1010} = 8 factors ✓
   - 2020: many factors ✓
   - **Answer: 7 factors have more than 3 factors → B**

**Shortcut to remember:**
- Primes (2, 5, 101) have exactly 2 factors → exclude
- Prime squares (4 = 2²) have exactly 3 factors → exclude
- Everything else has >3 factors!

**Practice 3-4 similar problems:**
- How many factors of 360 have more than 3 factors?
- How many factors of 100 have more than 3 factors?
- Find all factors of 180 that have exactly 4 factors

#### Part 2: Medium Problem Practice - Build Speed & Confidence (25 min)
**Practice 8-10 problems from the 11-16 range**

**Sources:** AMC 8 2019, 2022, 2023 (Problems 11-16)

**Focus areas:**
- Bar charts and data interpretation (Teresa can do these!)
- Percentage problems (she fixed #15 on redo!)
- Logic puzzles and systematic counting
- Basic number theory

**Goal:** 6-8/10 correct (60-80%)

**Strategy:**
- Use 3-Check System
- Apply 2-Minute Rule (don't get stuck)
- Build confidence by seeing success

#### Part 3: Celebrate BIG WINS from Day 5 Redo! (10 min)
**Teresa fixed FIVE problems - not four!**
- ✅ Fixed Problem 12 (factorials)
- ✅ Fixed Problem 14 (bar chart)
- ✅ **Fixed Problem 15 (percentage equations)** - She DOES understand this!
- ✅ Fixed Problem 19 (flippy numbers - HARD problem!)
- ✅ Fixed Problem 20 (tree heights - HARD problem!)

**Adjusted score with redo:** **17/25 (68%)** ← ABOVE baseline!

**Key message:** "You're at 68%! You fixed 5 problems on redo! You only need 3 MORE points to hit 80%. You've got this!"

**Path to 80%:**
```
Current:  17/25 (68%)
Needed:   20/25 (80%)
Gap:      Only 3 more problems!
```

## Day 7 - Monday, January 12
### **Advanced Medium Problems & Challenge Set** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Push Teresa into the 17-20 range with fresh problems

**🎉 UPDATE:** Teresa crushed Day 6! She completed problems 11-16 from AMC 8 2019, 2022, 2023 and only missed 2019 #16. She's ready for harder material!

#### Part 1: Review 2019 Problem 16 (10 min)
**The only one she missed from Day 6:**
- Study the logic puzzle approach
- Identify where her reasoning went wrong
- Practice systematic constraint checking

**Key strategy:** For complex logic puzzles, write down ALL constraints first, then test systematically

#### Part 2: Fresh Medium-Hard Problems from 2018 (25 min)
**Practice problems 14-18 from AMC 8 2018:**
- These are FRESH problems Teresa hasn't seen
- Mix of: data interpretation, logic, geometry, number theory
- **Time limit:** 15 minutes for 5 problems
- **Goal:** 3-4/5 correct

**Why 2018:**
- Haven't used this year yet (saved for weekend intensive)
- Good difficulty level
- Variety of problem types

#### Part 3: Challenge Problems from Hard Section (20 min)
**Teresa can solve hard problems - let's prove it!**

**Do problems 19-20 from AMC 8 2018:**
- She got 2019 #19, #20 and 2020 #19, #20, #22 correct on redo
- These are within her reach!
- **Strategy:** Use 2-Minute Rule - if stuck, move to next one

**Then try ONE problem 21-22 from 2018:**
- Pick the one that looks most approachable
- Goal: Build confidence that she CAN attempt hard problems
- Even if she doesn't get it, she learns the approach

#### Part 4: Pattern Recognition Exercise (5 min)
**Reflection activity:**
"What patterns did you notice today?"
- Are certain problem types easier for you?
- What strategies worked best?
- Which problems felt similar to ones you've solved before?

**This builds meta-cognition** - understanding HOW she solves problems, not just solving them

---

## Day 8 - Tuesday, January 14
### **Probability Fast Track** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Get at least 1/2 probability problems right (currently 0/2)

#### Part 1: Probability Crash Course (15 min)
**Basic formula:**
```
P(event) = favorable outcomes / total outcomes
```

**Common patterns:**
1. **Independent events:** Multiply probabilities
   - Example: P(heads AND heads) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4

2. **"At least one":** Use complement
   - P(at least one) = 1 - P(none)

3. **Counting outcomes:** Systematic listing
   - Make a table or tree diagram

#### Part 2: Guided Problem Solving (20 min)
**Study 2024 Problem 25** (airplane seats)
- Teresa chose A, correct is C
- Walk through solution step-by-step:
  1. Total ways to seat 2 people in 4 empty seats = combinations
  2. Ways to have 2 adjacent seats = count per row
  3. Calculate probability

**Practice 2 similar "arrangement" probability problems**

#### Part 3: Practice Set (20 min)
**Do 5-6 basic-to-medium probability problems**
- Focus on AMC 8-style (not competition-level hard)
- Sources: AMC 8 2017-2022 (excluding 2021), probability problems

**Goal:** Build intuition, not master all cases

#### Part 4: Probability Checklist (5 min)
**For every probability problem:**
- [ ] Identify total number of outcomes
- [ ] Identify favorable outcomes
- [ ] Set up fraction: favorable/total
- [ ] Simplify fraction
- [ ] Check: Is answer between 0 and 1?

**Reality check:** Teresa won't master probability in 1 hour, but might get 1-2 more right!

---

## Day 9 - Wednesday, January 15
### **Strategic Guessing & Problem Triage** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Maximize points when you don't know everything

#### Part 1: The Art of Strategic Guessing (20 min)
**Golden Rule:** NEVER leave a blank! (No penalty for wrong answers)

**Elimination Strategy:**
1. Cross out obviously wrong answers
2. Look for patterns in answer choices
   - If 4 choices are small, 1 is huge → probably not the huge one
   - If 4 choices are similar, 1 is different → check the different one
3. Use estimation
   - Example: If calculating area ≈ 50, eliminate choices like 200 or 5

**Practice:** Take 5 hard problems Teresa would normally skip
- For each: Eliminate 2-3 choices, then guess
- **Don't solve!** Just practice the elimination skill

#### Part 2: The 2-Minute Rule (20 min)
**Practice with 10 mixed problems:**

**For each problem:**
1. Read carefully (30 seconds)
2. If you know how to start → Solve (max 2 min total)
3. If you're stuck → Eliminate bad answers, guess, MOVE ON

**Goal:** Don't get bogged down on any single problem

**Time total:** Should finish all 10 in 20 minutes max

#### Part 3: Final Pass Strategy for Problems 21-25 (20 min)
**The Reality:** Problems 21-25 are HARD. Teresa doesn't need to master them.

**Strategy:**
1. **Quick read** all 5 problems (2 min)
2. **Pick 1-2** that seem most doable
3. **Spend 3-4 min** on those problems only
4. **Guess intelligently** on the rest using elimination

**Practice:** Use AMC 8 2019 Problems 21-25
- Set timer for 10 minutes
- Apply strategy above
- Score: ___/5 (Goal: 2-3 correct through combination of solving + lucky guessing)

---

## Day 10 - Thursday, January 16
### **PRACTICE TEST #2** (60 min)

**🎯 Goal:** Execute full strategy under pressure, aim for 18-20/25

- **Pass 2 (15 min):** Problems 14-20 → Attempt all, get 4-5/7
- **Pass 3 (10 min):** Problems 21-25 → Strategic attempts, get 2-3/5

#### Part 2: Immediate Debrief (20 min)
**Score the test:**

| Section | Score | Goal | Met Goal? |
|---------|-------|------|-----------|
| Problems 1-13 | ___/13 | 12-13 | ✅ / ❌ |
| Problems 14-18 | ___/5 | 3-4 | ✅ / ❌ |
| Problems 19-25 | ___/7 | 2-3 | ✅ / ❌ |
| **TOTAL** | **___/25** | **18-20** | ✅ / ❌ |

- Concept gaps: _______

**AMC 8 2018 (Today):**
- Careless errors: _______
- Concept gaps: _______

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Problem types where you're 0/3 or 1/3 → Maybe skip these on real test
- Problem types where you're 2/3 or 3/3 → These are your STRENGTHS!

### Part 2: Create Your "Cheat Sheet" (25 min)
**Make ONE PAGE with:**

**Formulas:**
- d = rt (distance = rate × time)
- Area of triangle = (1/2) × base × height
- Area of rectangle = length × width
- Probability = favorable outcomes / total outcomes
- (Add any others you keep forgetting)

**Common Traps:**
- [ ] Read problem TWICE before solving
- [ ] Watch out for "which is NOT" questions
- [ ] Check units (inches vs feet, minutes vs hours)
- [ ] Verify answer makes sense (negative area = wrong!)

**Time Management:**
- Pass 1: 15 min → Problems 1-13
- Pass 2: 15 min → Problems 14-20
- Pass 3: 10 min → Problems 21-25

### Part 3: Mental Rehearsal (5 min)
**Close your eyes and visualize test day:**

*"I walk into the room feeling confident. I have my pencils and eraser ready. When the test starts, I read Problem 1 twice. I solve it carefully and check my work. I move through Problems 1-13 steadily, getting 12-13 correct. On Problem 14, I read it twice, draw a diagram, and solve it step-by-step. If I get stuck, I skip it and come back. On Problems 21-25, I quickly scan them, pick the 1-2 that look doable, and guess smartly on the rest. When time is called, I've answered all 25 questions and scored 20+/25. I did it!"*

## FINAL REMINDERS

### For Teresa:
**You are SMART enough. You are PREPARED enough. You've GOT this!**

**Remember:**
- Read every problem twice (it's worth 10 seconds!)
- Show your work (even on easy ones)
- Don't get stuck (2-minute rule!)
- Guess smartly (eliminate wrong answers first)
- Stay calm (you know more than you think!)

**Your target:** 20/25 = 80%
**Your strategy:** Be perfect on easy, be smart on medium, be strategic on hard

**The secret:** You're already at 81% on Problems 1-13. Just don't mess those up, get half the medium ones right, and guess on the rest. That's 20/25. You can do this!

### For Parents/Coach:
**This plan is designed for a smart student who doesn't like lengthy practice.** Every hour is high-ROI. Trust the process.

**Keys to success:**
1. Enforce the 1-hour limit (don't over-practice)
2. Focus on eliminating careless errors (biggest point gain)
3. Teach strategy, not just content (when to skip, when to guess)
4. Keep it positive (celebrate progress, not just perfection)
5. Weekend intensive is crucial (don't skip it!)

**Good luck! 🍀**
