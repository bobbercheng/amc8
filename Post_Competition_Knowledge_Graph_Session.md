# Post-Competition: Mathematical Connections Session
## 2-Hour Knowledge Graph Workshop for Teresa

**When:** After AMC 8 2026 (Late January/Early February)
**Duration:** 2 hours
**Goal:** Develop mathematical maturity and connection-thinking for long-term success

---

## 📋 Session Overview

**Why This Session Matters:**
- Builds foundation for AMC 10, AIME, and beyond
- Develops "mathematical thinker" mindset (not just problem-solver)
- Teaches meta-skill that top STEM programs value
- Leverages Teresa's pattern recognition strength
- Makes learning intellectually engaging (reduces "practice fatigue")

**Perfect Timing:**
- ✅ After competition = no performance pressure
- ✅ Teresa already has content knowledge from study plan
- ✅ Can focus on connections, not just methods
- ✅ Time to explore properly (not rushed)

## 🎯 Session Structure

### **Hour 1: Introduction to Knowledge Graphs (60 min)**

#### Part 1: What is a Knowledge Graph? (15 min)
**Interactive demonstration:**
- Show example: How concepts in mathematics connect
- Explain nodes (concepts) and edges (relationships)
- Why this matters for mathematical thinking

**Example Graph - Simple:**
```
        Prime Numbers
              |
              ↓
      Prime Factorization
         /          \
        ↓            ↓
  Finding GCD    Counting Factors
        |              |
        ↓              ↓
   Simplifying     Factor Problems
   Fractions       (like Problem 17)
```

#### Part 2: Case Study - Problem 17 Deconstructed (20 min)
**Build the graph together:**

Starting question: "How many factors of 2020 have more than 3 factors?"

**Create the knowledge graph:**
```
                    PROBLEM 17
                        |
        ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
        ↓               ↓               ↓
    NUMBER 2020    FACTORS        COUNTING FACTORS
        |               |               |
        ↓               ↓               ↓
Prime Factorization  Systematic    Factor Formula
  (2² × 5 × 101)      Listing      τ(n) = (a+1)(b+1)...
        |               |               |
        ↓               ↓               ↓
Factor Tree Method  Building List  Recursive Count
                        ↓
                Factors of Factors
                (nested structure)
```

**Connections to explore:**
1. Prime Factorization → Foundation for ALL number theory
2. Factor Counting → Appears in GCD, LCM, perfect squares
3. Recursive Structure → "Factors of factors" is like functions of functions
4. Shortcut (exclude primes/prime²) → Comes from τ(n) formula

#### Part 3: Teresa Builds Her First Graph (25 min)
**Hands-on activity:**

Pick a concept Teresa learned during study plan:
- **Option A:** Percentage equations (Problem 15 type)
- **Option B:** Ratio problems (like 2024 #21 frogs)
- **Option C:** Speed/distance/rate problems

**Teresa's task:**
1. Start with the problem in the center
2. Identify all concepts needed to solve it
3. Draw connections between concepts
4. Explain WHY concepts connect (not just THAT they connect)

**Coach guides, Teresa draws**

### **Hour 2: Expanding the Mathematical Web (60 min)**

#### Part 1: The Big Picture - Number Theory (20 min)
**Create a comprehensive map:**

```
                    NUMBER THEORY
                         |
        ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
        ↓                ↓                ↓
    DIVISIBILITY     PRIMES         FACTORIZATION
        |                |                |
        ├─ Rules         ├─ Testing       ├─ Prime Factorization
        ├─ GCD/LCM       ├─ Distribution  ├─ Factor Counting
        └─ Modular       └─ Patterns      └─ Applications
           Arithmetic                          |
                                              ├─ GCD
                                              ├─ LCM
                                              ├─ Perfect Squares
                                              └─ Factor Problems
```

**Discussion:**
- How Teresa's learned concepts fit into this bigger picture
- Where she might see these concepts again (AMC 10, AIME)
- Connections she didn't realize existed

#### Part 2: Cross-Topic Connections (20 min)
**The "Aha!" moment - Topics aren't isolated:**

Show how concepts from DIFFERENT areas connect:

```
Coordinate Geometry ←→ Distance Formula ←→ Pythagorean Theorem
         ↓                                        ↓
    Area Problems  ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←→  Right Triangles
         ↓                                        ↓
   Optimization   ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←→  Geometry + Algebra
```

**Examples from Teresa's practice:**
- 2023 #15 (speed/distance) connects to coordinate geometry
- 2024 #21 (ratios) connects to systems of equations
- Problem 17 (factors) connects to perfect squares, GCD, LCM

#### Part 3: Building Your Own Knowledge Base (15 min)
**Teach Teresa the system:**

**Step 1: Create a "Math Notebook"**
- Section for each major topic (Number Theory, Geometry, Algebra, Counting)
- Add problems she solves
- Draw mini-graphs showing connections

**Step 2: The "Connection Question"**
After solving any problem, ask:
- "What other problems use this same concept?"
- "How does this connect to what I already know?"
- "What's the deeper pattern here?"

**Step 3: Weekly Review**
- Spend 15 minutes updating her knowledge graphs
- Add new problems/concepts
- Find new connections

#### Part 4: Looking Ahead (5 min)
**The Long Game:**

```
     AMC 8 (NOW)
         ↓
  Knowledge Graphs → Deeper Understanding
         ↓
     AMC 10 (8th-10th grade)
         ↓
  More Connections → Mathematical Maturity
         ↓
     AIME (Top 5%)
         ↓
  Pattern Recognition → Competitive Edge
         ↓
  USAMO/College Math → STEM Leadership
```

**Key message:** "You're not just learning to solve problems. You're learning to THINK mathematically. That's what makes great mathematicians."

1. ✅ Understand what knowledge graphs are and why they matter
2. ✅ Have created 2-3 knowledge graphs of her own
3. ✅ See how concepts she learned connect to bigger picture
4. ✅ Have a system for building her own knowledge base
5. ✅ Understand how this helps with AMC 10, AIME, and beyond

## 📚 Materials Needed

**Physical:**
- Large whiteboard or poster paper
- Colored markers (different colors for different concept types)
- Index cards (for nodes)
- String or yarn (for connections, optional)

**Digital (Optional):**
- Tablet/computer with graph software
- Or simple drawing app

**Reference:**
- Teresa's study plan materials
- Problems she solved during practice
- AMC 8 problem sets

---

## 🎨 Teaching Tips

**For Teresa's Learning Style:**
1. **Make it visual** - Use colors, shapes, spatial arrangement
2. **Make it interactive** - She draws, not just watches
3. **Pattern-first** - "See the structure?" not "Memorize this"
4. **Intellectual challenge** - Frame as puzzle-solving, not practice
5. **Quick wins** - Start simple, build complexity

**Engagement Strategies:**
- Ask "What do you notice?" (pattern recognition strength)
- Let her discover connections (not tell her)
- Celebrate "aha!" moments
- Connect to her interests (efficiency, smart shortcuts)

**Avoid:**
- Long lectures (she gets bored)
- Repetitive exercises (goes against her style)
- Abstract without concrete examples
- Making it feel like homework

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

**This session is successful if:**
1. Teresa says "That's interesting!" or "I never thought about it that way"
2. She creates at least one graph independently
3. She asks questions about connections (curiosity activated)
4. She sees value in continuing this practice
5. She feels excited about deeper mathematical thinking

**This session fails if:**
- She's confused and frustrated
- She sees it as "more practice"
- She doesn't engage or participate
- She can't explain why connections matter

---

## 🔄 Follow-Up Plan

**Ongoing (Optional):**
- Monthly 30-min "Knowledge Graph Update" sessions
- Review new concepts from school
- Add to her growing mathematical web
- Prepare for AMC 10 with this framework

**Resources for Teresa:**
- Art of Problem Solving forums (other students doing this)
- Math competition preparation books (that emphasize connections)
- Online resources for mathematical thinking

---

## 💡 Why This Matters Long-Term

**For AMC 10 (next year):**
- Problems require seeing deeper patterns
- Knowledge graphs make studying more efficient
- Reduces "each problem is new" syndrome

**For AIME (if she qualifies):**
- Top performers think in connections, not isolated facts
- This is the meta-skill that separates good from great

**For Top STEM Programs:**
- MIT/Stanford/Caltech want students who see structure
- This thinking style is what they're looking for
- Foundation for research-level mathematics

**Personal Development:**
- Builds intellectual curiosity (loves learning)
- Reduces "practice fatigue" (seeks understanding)
- Develops her natural pattern recognition strength
